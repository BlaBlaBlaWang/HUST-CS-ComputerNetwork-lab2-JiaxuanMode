# LAB2：Reliable Data Transforming

This responsory contains mediate codes and project files while establishing my own GBN、SR、TCP version RDT protocols.

Now,the project is finished and waiting for TA to check.

To use this project,open the ``StopWait.sln`` file in this directory with VS Studio IDE, whose version is older than VS 2017, or other more skillful ways if you like :) 

Since the original project directory is plain as you can see, and with so many headers and reliable relationships,I didn't change the overall directory architecture, which makes the project seems messy, but virtual directory has been changed in VS project, and the logical topology is simple.

To test the project, use ``Debug/check_win.bat`` with input file in the same directory, if nothing overwhelming is printed on the terminal, then the program is correct. For linux players you can use  ``Debug/check_linux.sh`` for checking.

To be honest, this is my first trial in C++, so the codes may seem more like C's style. But I will keep on practicing to write more elegant codes!
